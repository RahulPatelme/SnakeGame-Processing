# Snake Game

Guide:

When the game begins, the snake will appear on the top left corner of the sketch, with a food generated at a random location.
When the snake consumes a food, a new food is created at a random location.
If the snake breaches the environment's borders, the player loses the game.
To devour the food, move the snake using the arrow keys to the appropriate location.
